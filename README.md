# CLInote

CLInote is a command line client for Evernote inspired by [geeknote](https://github.com/VitaliyRodnenko/geeknote).

CLInote allows you to:

* Create notes
* Send the note content to stdout
* Edit notes in your $EDITOR
* Create new notebooks
* Search for notes

## Installation

From source:
```
git clone https://github.com/artenax/clinote
cd clinote/cmd
export GOARCH=386
export GOOS=linux
go build -ldflags="-s -w"

```

Download pre-build binary from the [release page](https://github.com/artenax/clinote/releases).

## Authorize to Evernote via OAuth

Before you can use any features, you need to authorize CLInote to access youre notes. To authorize run the command:
```
clinote user login
```
If you have your default browser defined in the $BROWSER environment variable, CLInote will open the link in your default browser.

## Authenticating with the Evernote Cloud API using Tokens

Before you can use any features, you need to generate an API token for CLInote to use. Generate a
token [here](https://dev.evernote.com/doc/articles/dev_tokens.php).
To add a new set of user credentials, run the command:

```
clinote user add
```

To add sandbox credentials, run the command:

```
clinote user add --sandbox
```

You can list the credentials with the command:

```
clinote user list
```

To set a credential as active use the command `clinote user set credential "index"`. For example:

```
clinote user set credential 1
```

## Create a new note

A new note can be created with the command shown below. A title needs to be given for the note. If no notebook is given, the default notebook will be used. The new note can be open in the $EDITOR by using the edit flag.

```
clinote note new --title "note title" [--notebook "notebook name"] [--edit]
```

## Edit note

Notes can be edited using the edit command. If no flags are set, the note is opened
with the editor defined by the environment variable $EDITOR. The first line will be used as the note title and the rest is encoded as the note content.

To change to title, the title flag can be used.

The note can be moved to another notebook by defining the new notebook
with the notebook flag.
```
clinote note edit "note title" [--title "new note title"] [--notebook "new notebook"]
```

### Recover note that failed to save

If clinote fails to save a note, the note can be reopened for editing using the `--recover` flag.

```
clinote note edit --recover
```

## Show note content

You can send the note content to the standard out with the command below:
```
clinote note "note title"
```

## Remove a note

Delete moves the note into the trash. The note may still be undeleted, unless it is expunged.
To expunge the note you need to use the official client or the web client.
```
clinote note delete "note title"
```

## Search for notes

To search for notes, use the list command as shown below.
```
clinote note list [--count 20] [--search "search term"] [--notebook "notebook name"]
```
The search term flag can be used to define a search term
to be used. The search can be restricted to a notebook
by using the notebook flag.

Count can be used to restrict the maximum number of notes
returned.

If no search term is given, a wild card search will be used.
The notes will be sorted by the modified time.

### View/edit/remove notes returned in the search list

You can view, edit, or remove notes returned by the list command
using the note's index number. For example to show the content
of the first note in the list, use the following command:

```
clinote note 1
```

To remove the 5th note in the list, use:

```
clinote note delete 5
```

## Create a new notebook

To create a new notebook, use the command below:
```
clinote notebook new "notebook name" [--default] [--stack "Stack name"]
```

## Edit a notebook

To edit a notebook use this command:
```
clinote notebook edit "notebook name" [--name "new notebook name"] [--stack "new stack"]
```

## List all notebooks

To list all notebooks, use the notebook list command:
```
clinote notebook list
```
